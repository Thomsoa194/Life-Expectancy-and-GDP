# Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-
 Analyze GDP and life expectancy data from the World Health Organization and World Bank. GDP is Gross Domestic Product and is a meausurement of a country's overall economic output.

## Some questions I aim to answer are:
 Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
 Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
 Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
 What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
 
## The key findings of the data analysis are

 With the USA having the largest Gross Domestic Product, China's will continue to grow at a faster rate.
 Life expectancy has increased for all countries between 2010 and 2015.
 As an average over the period of 2000 and 2015, China's GDP is roughly 40 percent of the USA's GDP.
 Zimbabwe's life expectancy is growing exponentially, although it is currently on average 50 years old. Whilst Germany has an average GDP of just 79 years old.
 There is a strong association between Life expectancy and GDP, they have a positive covariance.
 The distribution of Zimbabwe's life expectancy is enormous. Mexico has the lowest distribution.
