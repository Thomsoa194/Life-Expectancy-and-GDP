# Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-
 Analyze GDP and life expectancy data from the World Health Organization and World Bank

## Some questions I aim to answer are:
 Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
 Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
 Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
 What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
